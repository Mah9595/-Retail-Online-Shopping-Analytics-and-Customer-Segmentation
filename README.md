# -Retail-Online-Shopping-Analytics-and-Customer-Segmentation

Online buying and selling have become integral parts of many peopleâ€™s lives. Virtual stores have made it exceedingly easy to buy and sell things. Heck, even this website is considered an online store!

With so much activity happening online, tons of data is generated daily as well. Mining purchase data and forming a better understanding of customer segments can help companies more money. This is why so many e-commerce companies are ramping up on their data analysis.

We will be using this dataset from UCL Machine Learning Repository for this project. This UpLevel project will combine both traditional customer segmentation techniques and unsupervised machine learning techniques to segregate customers.
